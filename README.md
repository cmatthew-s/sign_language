# Sign Language
A project to help predict sign language in alphabets

## File Systems
1. GestureDetector.py - Is the custom module specializing to predict the sign language
2. sign_to_text.py - The goal is to standardizing the video frames and write the data
3. model.py - Is where we generate the model itself using K-Means Clustering
4. predict_sign.py - Predict the input sign languages and display the output

##Future Aims
1. To add another feature including detection of words or phrases
2. Minimize bias in letters with similar sign gestures - increase accuracy
